## What is PromethiumJS?

PromethiumJS is a JavaScript UI framework built on top of [Lit](https://lit.dev) that provides the following features:

- [Functional components](/core-concepts/functional-components) (components that are made up of just pure functions).

:::note
Functional components built with PromethiumJS are _not_ web components.
:::

- Signal-based global state management (inspired by [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/)).
- A client-side router (although there's already a [router available in lit labs](https://github.com/lit/lit/tree/main/packages/labs/router) if you prefer that).
- Other useful tools and primitives.

It's as simple as that!
