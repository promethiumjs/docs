## What is PromethiumJS?

PromethiumJS is a JavaScript UI framework built on top of [Lit](https://lit.dev) that augments it by:

- Allowing you to build functional components (components that are made up of just pure functions) with [lit-html](https://lit.dev/docs/libraries/standalone-templates/).
- Providing a global state management solution.
- Providing a client-side router (although there's a [router](https://github.com/lit/lit/tree/main/packages/labs/router) in [lit labs](https://github.com/lit/lit/tree/main/packages/labs)).
- Giving you other useful tools and primitives to make your life easier.

It's as simple as that!
