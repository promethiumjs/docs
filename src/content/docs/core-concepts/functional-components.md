## Components in PromethiumJS

There generally two recommended ways of creating components with PromethiumJS:

- Extending the `LitElement` base class from Lit to create [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components).
- Creating functional components using PromethiumJS primitives and the `html` tag function from Lit.
