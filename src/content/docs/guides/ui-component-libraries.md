title: UI Component Libraries 
description: Some UI component libraries you can use with PromethiumJS.
---

UI component libraries have proven quite essential to modern frontend development.
Here are a few libraries we recommend checking out that work pretty well with Lit and PromethiumJS:

- [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/)
- [Material Web Components](https://github.com/material-components/material-web)
- [Spectrum Web Components](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-web-components/index.html)
- [Fluent UI Web Components](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fluent-ui/web-components/)
- [Lion](https://lion-web.netlify.app/)

We're also working on integrations with [ZagJS](https://zagjs.com/) and [Ark-UI](https://ark-ui.com/), incredible libraries from the [Chakra team](https://github.com/chakra-ui), but these are not certain so do well not to rely on them.

- For tables, you could check out [TanStack Table's Vanilla TS/JS adapter](https://tanstack.com/table/v8/docs/adapters/vanilla). Maybe we'll make an adapter for PromethiumJS or a generic Web Components adapter, but please don't rely on those as well.
